            <h1>What is an Inverse Relationship?</h1>
            <p>An inverse relationship is identified between two variables, which are interrelated but the change of one causes the opposite change to the other.</p>
            <p>Newton's second law says that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object's mass.</p>
            <p>According to the second law, there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration and an inverse relationship between mass and acceleration</p>
